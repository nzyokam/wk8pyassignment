# Week 8 Python Assignment - COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 data to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and understand the pandemic's impact across countries and demographics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore a rich dataset of COVID-19 statistics.
- Analyze case counts, deaths, vaccinations, and testing metrics.
- Identify trends, anomalies, and insights using data visualization and summaries.
- Communicate findings clearly using markdown narratives in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive code and narrative combination

## ▶️ How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Week 8 Python Assignment.ipynb`) using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in order (`note: this is in the order they appear not the order the numbers states`) to load the data, generate visuals, and read insights.
4. Review markdown cells for summary and reflections.

## 🔍 Insights and Reflections

-  India recorded a prolonged early phase with zero reported cases – suggesting either delayed outbreak or underreporting.
-  Testing and ICU data have high missing values in many countries – a potential limitation in analysis.
-  Vaccination progress can be monitored in detail, including partial and booster doses.
-  Socioeconomic and demographic variables are included, supporting rich correlation studies.
-  Population skew, particularly from countries like India and China, has a strong influence on per-million metrics.

This analysis highlights the power and limitations of real-world pandemic data and underscores the value of thoughtful preprocessing and clear presentation.
